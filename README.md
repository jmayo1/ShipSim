# ShipSim
Master's Thesis - simulation for 2 ships

Takes 2 identical, parameterized ships and finds the time required prior to a collision to begin a manoeuvre in order
to maintain a desired amount of separation between them.

See results outlined in the following publications:

OCEANS 2021: San Diego – Porto · Sep 18, 2021
iSSN: 0197-7385

Output plot looks similar to the following, where the blue path is the path of the controlled vessel, the red path is the path of the intruder and the green 
circle is the desired safety boundary
